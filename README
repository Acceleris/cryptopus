Cryptopus

= WARNING =

Please remember that putting all your 
passwords together in database and make
this database accessible over the internet
might be a relevant security thread and risk. 
As well at the end the security on these 
passwords will only lie in the security of your 
SSL-secured connection (never use an unencrypted
connection!), as well (and this is the main
point) in the security of your main password.
So be wise while using it, choose a good 
password. And cryptopus won't make your 
passwords more secure! It gives you only the 
possibility to manage them in a nice way, 
store them in a safe manner and share them with 
other peoples you'd like to.
