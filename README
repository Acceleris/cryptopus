Cryptopus

= WARNING =

Please remember that putting all your passwords together in database and making
this database accessible over the internet might be a relevant security threat
and that should be considered prior to using cryptopus.
In the end the passwords and keys are only as safe as the host that is running
cryptopus and the SSL-secured connections (never use an unencrypted
connection!), as well (and this is the main point) as the strength of your main
password.
So calculate the risk this setup might pose and choose a good password.
Cryptopus won't make your passwords more secure! It simply gives you the
possibility to manage them in a nice way, store them in a safe manner and share
them with other people you'd like to.
